# CAP 4104 Human-Computer Interaction UI/UX Design with Streamlit Project
A web application is an interactive computer program developed using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), which stores (Database, Files) and manipulates data (CRUD - create, read, update and delete). Webapps can be used by a team or single user to perform tasks over the internet.

The goal of this project is to apply the Usability Goals and Design Principles learned in class into the development of a web application using Streamlit. The project needs to manipulate data requested through an API.

This project uses Streamlit and data from RapidAPI to create a COVID-19 dashboard web application.
